                <p>
                    I hold a Level 5 RNCP diploma (equivalent to Associate's degree) in Web Development from OpenClassrooms and a verified CS50 certificate from Harvard. 
                    While my foundation is in web development, I've fallen in love with C programming and am actively expanding into IoT development.<br><br>
                    My vision is to create end-to-end solutions that span from hardware design and low-level programming to intuitive web interfaces for data visualization and device control. 
                    I specialize in connecting embedded systems with modern web applications, transforming raw sensor data and hardware functionality into accessible, user-friendly experiences.<br><br>
                    A recent project that exemplifies this approach is a C program profiling library that generates JSON output, paired with a Flask application for uploading and visualizing performance data through interactive charts and analytics. 
                    This reflects my core interest: making embedded systems and low-level programming accessible through elegant web interfaces.
